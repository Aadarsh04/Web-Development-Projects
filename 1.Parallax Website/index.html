            <h2 class="description">Football</h2>
        </div>
            <p class="text">
                Football, unlike cricket, has no moment of dullness. There is excitement till the last second of the 90-minute game. The joy of passing the ball from the jungle of opponents, and the joy of smashing the ball to the goal is priceless. As the player is moving forward with the ball, there is always that danger of getting the ball snatched away by the opponent. Then there are expert players like Messi or Beckham who magically make the ball take a curve-turn all the while in the air. 
                <br> <br>
                There are also heated exchanges among the players. The players take the competition very seriously. No football fan can ever forget the head-butt of Zidane or the attitude of Ronaldo. At the same time, one can also never forget the moment of the Croatian President hugging the players of the country who sadly lost the World Cup Final in 2018. The emotions run high.

            <h2 class="description" id="description-1">Cricket</h2>
        </div>
            <p class="text">
                Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). 
                <br> <br>
                Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.
